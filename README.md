# Real-Time-Embedded-System-Maze-Solver
This repository contains files written in C for the development of a maze solver car robot at New York University Tandon School of Engineering

Pending:
- Modify algorithm to first run until it finds a wall. Then proceed with the algorithm itself.
- Include PWM (20 CAM). (DONE)
- Input capture.
- Add sensor interaction.
- First basic algorithm.
